# CharliesSentinelToken (SENTINEL)

**Vita ex Morte — From Death Comes Life**  
**Innocent Victims Never Forgotten**

CharliesSentinelToken (SENTINEL) is a deflationary Ethereum-based token created in honour of **Charlie Burgoyne** — an innocent child, a beloved sister and daughter, killed in a car crash by a drink driver.

Her life was stolen by reckless action.  
Her memory was silenced by design — by a system that protects itself, not the people it was meant to serve.

## What Is SENTINEL?

SENTINEL is **not a token of sympathy** — it is a **tool of resistance**.

- Built on truth  
- Forged in grief  
- Driven by the mission to **break the cycle of institutional betrayal**  

## Intentions

- Provide real, lasting support for surviving families:  
  grief space, survival funds, legal empowerment
- End false narratives, protect the truth, expose systemic abuse
- Fund memorial preservation and justice campaigns
- Deliver decentralised, unmanipulated support for victims
- Transfer value into **truth, resistance, and empowerment**
